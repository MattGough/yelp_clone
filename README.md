## Yelp Clone

This is a basic clone of Yelp built using Ruby on Rails. Following the Makers Academy [guide](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/rails/yelp.md). Basic functionality included creating, reading, deleting and updating restaurants, reviews(linked to restaurants) and user sign up, in & out. The project also includes the ability to sign in through Facebook using [0Auth](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/).

Unit testing was done using RSpec and feature testing was done with Capybara.

Created by myself, Frazer Watson, Yan-yi Li & Mark Hill.
